Weeding and weed suppression for long term maintenance. Weed control is at the top of everyone's most hated gardening chore - for good reason. It is often viewed as frustrating, annoying and never-ending. However, it doesn't need to be. Often just getting on top of the task is all it takes. We provide both short and long term control for weeds. This includes the more immediate short term thorough removal of weeds and also long term control methods such as mulching and soil conditioning that will drastically reduce their reappearance and spread.
