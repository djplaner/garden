Rejuvenating an existing cottage-style garden. Reclaiming it's old-world charm and breathing new life into it's forgotten corners. 

A quaint cottage-style garden set on a 732 m<sup>2</sup> suburban block with many established tropical and temperate fruit trees. A garden in which the previous owner had spent much of her time and which was one of the reasons Narelle purchased her new home. However, due to a lack of time the garden had become wile and overgrown. No longer a source of joy.

Our original brief was to simply get back some control over the garden. _...but evolved into some thing more???__
