When the septic backed up, the garden had to change. A personal project designing a garden to fit with the property's new French Formal style and to support a new evapo-transpiration bed for the septic system.

Originally a market garden serving the Toowoomba and Gatton region _Duck Meadows_ - named for the flocks of ducks visiting the property's dam and surrounding meadows - is our home. When we arrived, Duck Meadows' best days were behind it. Both the homestead and the grounds were in need of renovation ... then the septic system backed up.

# What was done

## Formal garden

The formal garden is the major garden project (so far). 

### Design

The brief for the formal garden had two priorities: function and aesthetics.

Functionally, the garden had to support a new evapo-transpiration bed for the septic system. Helping with evaporation and reducing foot and vehicular traffic over the bed.

Aesthetically, the garden had to be in keeping with the French Formal style of the house.

### Upkeep (aka maintenance)


# **Older content**

Duck Meadows is the name given to our property from well before our time here. It is the original homestead that acted as a market garden for the surrounding areas of Toowoomba and Gatton. From our time here the name Duck Meadows is certainly fitting given the number of whistling ducks that visit our nearby dam - particularly in the recent wet seasons. 

The below before and after photos show the progression of our time at Duck Meadows - not only on the gardens which is certainly a big focus of my work here but also on the homestead that we are renovating. 

## Formal Garden
One of the major projects for Duck Meadows not only in terms of design but in trying to fit a particular style I liked (French Formal) with the existing house and gardens we have. 

The biggest consideration for this project however, was of a practical nature. I had initially designed an evapo-transpiration bed for our septic system and I needed a garden that would help in the function of this system as well as reduce any potential traffic (both foot traffic but certainly any vehicular or heavy machinery traffic). I settled on this particular design because it was one that I liked aesthetically but it would also achieve the functional and practical requirements of what could not readily be seen beneath the surface: our evapo-transpiration bed.
