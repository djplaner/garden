Duck Meadows is the name given to our property from well before our time here. It is the original homestead that acted as a market garden for the surrounding areas of Toowoomba and Gatton. From our time here the name Duck Meadows is certainly fitting given the number of whistling ducks that visit our nearby dam - particularly in the recent wet seasons. 

The below before and after photos show the progression of our time at Duck Meadows - not only on the gardens which is certainly a big focus of my work here but also on the homestead that we are renovating. 

## Formal Garden
One of the major projects for Duck Meadows not only in terms of design but in trying to fit a particular style I liked (French Formal) with the existing house and gardens we have. 

The biggest consideration for this project however, was of a practical nature. I had initially designed an evapo-transpiration bed for our septic system and I needed a garden that would help in the function of this system as well as reduce any potential traffic (both foot traffic but certainly any vehicular or heavy machinery traffic). I settled on this particular design because it was one that I liked aesthetically but it would also achieve the functional and practical requirements of what could not readily be seen beneath the surface: our evapo-transpiration bed.
