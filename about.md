Hi, I'm Sandy. My business _Sandy's Gardening & Landscape Design_ provides gardening services for those in the Toowoomba and Lockyer Valley area. We also provide landscape design services over a much larger geographical area. 

I live in Postman's Ridge in the Valley just east of Toowoomba with my husband, mum, youngest son and Rex our very spoilt German Shepherd.

## My Services
 
We offer a full spectrum of gardening services, from [general garden maintenance](/gardening/) to [full-scale design and 'builds'](/design/). Each service reflects my commitment to sustainability and exceptional customer care. Passionate about the planet and superior service, I strive to make every project eco-friendly and deliver outstanding customer satisfaction.

## About Me

I'm a self-confessed plant addictâ€”the type who goes shopping for a few things and returns with a car full of plants, often sneaking them in to avoid the "More plants?!" comment from my husband. Yes, I am that person.

Born and raised in rural Queensland, Australia, I've always had a strong connection to the land. My career has spanned various industries, from hospitality to civil and structural engineering. Now, I'm grateful to be doing what I love: creating and maintaining beautiful gardens while helping others enjoy their outdoor spaces.

## My Clients

I have been, and continue to be, very fortunate with the people I have worked for, and with, in my business. My clients range from busy professionals such as [Narelle](/projects/narelle/) <link here> to equally busy retirees such as Cherryl (pictured below with Perry helping). However, regardless of whether they are 'newbies' or 'old hands' I am genuinely always learning from them - about plants, gardening and life!!
