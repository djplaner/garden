Hi, I'm Sandy and welcome to my website for Sandy's Gardening & Landscape Design. I provide gardening services for those in the Toowoomba and Lockyer Valley area as well as landscape design services over a much larger geographical area. 

I live in Postman's Ridge in the Valley just east of Toowoomba with my husband, mum, youngest son and Rex our very spoilt German Shepherd. I am a self-confessed plant addict - the type of person that ducks out for a few things at the shop and comes back laden with a car boot full of different plants and none of the things I originally went out to get.  The type of person who tries to sneakily unload the back of the car before their husband can offer the refrain 'More plants?!!!'. Yes, I am *that* person.

## My Services

Here at Sandy's Gardening & Landscape Designs I offer a full and comprehensive range of services, from general garden maintenance to full-scale design and 'builds'. While my services cover a full and diverse range (yes I even offer holiday care too!) they are all a reflection of who I am and my core set of values. I am passionate about the planet and just as passionate about the notion of superior service. Therefore, in every service I provide I'm always thinking of how I can make it more sustainable and eco-friendly. I also place the highest value on giving and receiving exceptional customer service.  Perhaps both of these passions are fitting given that - at least according to Wikipedia - the name Sandy is often associated with those who are protective and have a 'natural inclination to assist others'. 

## About Me

Born and raised in rural (and sometimes remote) Queensland Australia I've always had a strong connection to the land. A common refrain of mine, even now in very middle age (okay I'm being very generous to myself) is that 'I don't know what I want to be when I grow up'. 

I've pursued careers in a range of different industries: hospitality (a fine dining waitress and barmaid), health and fitness (a personal fitness trainer), Information Technology (a programmer), academia (lecturer) and engineering (civil/structural). 

As a side hustle to these careers I have, amongst other things, operated a small beef cattle property with my husband, broken in horses and had a very short stint as a real estate agent (don't even ask how that went). More recently, my husband and I have been, and continue to be, involved in the ongoing task of renovating the homestead and grounds of Duck Meadows.

Currently, I'm very happy to say that I'm following (or perhaps indulging is more correct) my passion in plants. I am very grateful to be doing what I love - maintaining and building beautiful gardens - and helping others in the process.
