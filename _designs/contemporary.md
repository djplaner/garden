# Modern/Contemporary

The modern or contemporary garden certainly lends itself more readily to sustainable practices. While there are many different ideas of what makes a modern design 'modern' there are a few key principles that are typically employed. Perhaps one of the features that most distinguish a modern or contemporary design is in the use of hardscaping: integrated seating, art pieces, water features, outdoor lighting and vertical gardening - all tend to feature quite heavily in these designs. In terms of softscaping sculptural plants with a minimalist palette are usually employed. 

1. Hardscaping/softscaping balance. 

    When we are talking about hardscaping we are usually talking about the man-made elements of the garden. This includes gravel pathways, pavers outdoor living spaces. Softscaping refers specifically to the living elements of the landscape design: the plants, trees and flowers that are used. In a modern/contemporary design there is typically a very strong sense of the man-made elements. Such a focus can help minimise reliance on maintenance heavy parts of the garden such as lawn which helps to reduce the carbon footprint. 

2. Minimalism. 

    A strong focus on straightforward and simple geometries can also help with long-term maintenance. They are less fussy and cluttered than say a cottage garden is and it is very much a case of what you see is what you get. Hence, it is much easier to not only start out with a garden that looks great but more importantly to keep it looking great. Low maintenace gardens tend to be ones that have better 'green' credentials than ones that don't. 

3. Sculptural plants.

    A focus on sculptural plants - plants that have distinctive forms are often employed. Many of these plants are succulents, ornamental grasses and native plants. These plants are typically low on their water requirements and require no fertlising.
