# Formal Garden

Formal gardens would certainly seem to be the antithesis of an environmentally friendly garden but there are a number of ways such a garden naturally achieves such credibility and can be readily desiged with environmental sustainability in mind. A formal garden focuses on the following: symmetry and balance, geometric patterns, architecutral plants, focal points, a limited colour palette and walkways. All of these can be achieved while keeping sound environmental practices in mind.

Let's look at why such a garden lends itself to environmentally sound practices and how it can be achieved. 

1. Limited lawn. 

    While many formal gardens do have sections of lawn the area covered tends to be limited. The focus is on creating symmetry and geometric patterns with hedges and other plants. Limiting the amount of lawn you have is always a good idea when you are thinking about the environment.  

2. Hedging. 

    The focus on hedging in formal gardens to edge walkways and create various patterns and shapes is definitely one that can help to reduce your environmental footprint. Traditional hedging plants such as buxus and rosemary are actually quite hardy and do not require a great deal of irrigation. Depending on drainage they can also cope quite well with our increasingly chaotic weather patterns. Slow growing hedging plants like buxus also reduce the demand for laborious maintenance. 

3. Walkways and pathways. 

    Again, a focus on walkways and pathways essentially limits the requirements for greenspace and the upkeep that requires. A significant portion of area in a formal garden can be occupied by pathways which reduces the need for irrigation and maintenance of garden beds.
