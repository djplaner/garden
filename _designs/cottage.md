# Cottage Garden

The typical image most people have of a cottage garden is one that is high maintenance - only a garden suitable for those of us with endless amounts of time to spend in the garden watering and weeding. However, it doesn't have to be this way. Cottage gardens are focused on the idea of abundance: an abundance of plants, an abundance of colour, an abundance of different sights, smells and shapes. Unlike the formal and modern garden they are almost wild and untamed in their design. Of course the best cottage gardens are designed even if in an ongoing and relatively informal way. While traditionally there is a focus on high maintenance plants such as roses and perennials there is no reason why these plants can't be minimised or eliminated entirely from the design. Careful selection of plant types and grouping plants that have the same requirements can create the same overall impression as a traditional high-maintenace cottage garden. 

Here are some reasons why cottage gardens can lend themselves to better environmental outcomes than one might initially expect.

1. Minimal lawn. 
 
    Many of the cottage gardens you see focus more on the garden beds and what is in them than in the lawns. Cottage gardens are known for the sprawling and rambling plants than they are for perfectly manicured lawns. Again, anything that minimises the reliance on lawn is something to be encouraged in environmentally friendly gardens.

2. Free-flowing geometries. 

    Curves and winding pathways characterise cottage gardens which makes it less noticeable in terms of when things need maintenance.

3. Attract pollinators and birds. 
 
    A cottage garden's focus on flowering shrubs and perennials make it easy to attract and feed bees, birds and butterflies.
