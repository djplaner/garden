Shh!... hear that? Probably not. That's the sound our battery powered equipment makes when mowing your lawn. We provide a quieter, less disruptive mowing service for you and your neighbours. Moreover, our self-mulching lawn-mowers promote a healthier lawn by adding precious nutrients back the soil where they are needed the most. Enjoy a lush more vibrant lawn without disturbing the peace.

Some key points of our mowing service:

1. Eco-friendly equipment - we rely exclusively on the use of battery-powered equipment. Reducing emissions and noise pollution in residential areas is important to us. 

2. Sustainable lawn care techniques - cutting at the correct height for each season, spot removal of weeds and self-mulching lawn mowers. These are all proven techniques that promote a lush more vibrant lawn without the need for synthetic fertiliser. 

3. Automated lawn mower installation - avoid the noise and hassle of mowing altogether by having your very own robot lawnmower installed. 

4. Lawn alternatives - reducing lawn area, alternative groundcovers and drought-tolerant landscaping. Many options exist for those wanting to avoid the maintenance and costs associated with lawns altogether.
