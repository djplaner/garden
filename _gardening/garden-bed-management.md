Drumroll please! Welcome to the stage the biggest performers of your garden. From the richly fragrant gardenias and roses to the show-stopping coloured annuals. All have a role to play. Let us give them the full five star treatment they deserve to ensure your outdoor spaces dazzle all year round. 

Some key points of our service include:

1. Specialised ornamental care: whether it's your Mr Lincoln rose or your Sasanqua Camellia that you want to give some extra special attention to we will provide the extra TLC they need. 

2. Pest and Disease Management: does every bug, insect or general pest seem to love your favourite plants as much as you do? Blackspot running rampant through your roses? Whether it's a case of aphids or fungal problems let us help you get on top of things without resorting to chemical warfare.

3. Soil Enrichment: at Sandy's Gardening & Landscape Design we recognise that if there is any real 'secret' to a great garden it's even greater soil. We employ a number of eco-friendly techniques that replenish nutrients and promote soil health ensuring your garden looks great year round - secret or no secret.
